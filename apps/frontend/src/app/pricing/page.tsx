  {
    q: 'How does the AI matching work?',
    a: 'Cleya uses a conversational AI to understand your goals, industry, stage, and preferences. Our matching engine then scores compatibility across multiple dimensions — sector fit, stage alignment, geographic proximity, and complementary strengths — to surface the most relevant connections.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I try before I pay?',
    a: 'Yes. The Free plan gives you access to core features with a limited number of matches. Professional and Growth plans include a 14-day free trial so you can experience the full platform before committing.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What makes Cleya different from LinkedIn?',
    a: 'LinkedIn is a broadcast platform — you connect with thousands but rarely get meaningful introductions. Cleya is curated and AI-driven. Every match comes with context, mutual interest confirmation, and facilitated warm intros. Quality over quantity.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is my data safe?',
    a: 'Absolutely. We use end-to-end encryption for messages, never share your data with third parties, and comply with Indian data protection regulations. Your contact information is only revealed after both parties accept a match.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you offer enterprise plans?',
    a: 'Yes. For accelerators, VCs, and large teams, we offer custom enterprise plans with dedicated support, SSO, custom matching rules, and API access. Contact us at enterprise@cleya.ai.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I cancel anytime?',
    a: 'Yes. All paid plans are month-to-month with no lock-in. You can cancel or downgrade at any time from your account settings.',
